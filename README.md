# Head Detection and Object Tracking using YOLO 8

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting human heads in images and videos using YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model. Additionally, it includes an object tracker that identifies moving objects in frames and counts their occurrences.

## Features
- **Head Detection with YOLO 8**:
  - Utilizes pre-trained YOLO 8 weights to detect human heads.
  - Provides bounding boxes around detected heads.
- **Object Tracking**:
  - Implements an object tracker (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT) to follow moving objects across frames.
  - Counts the occurrences of tracked objects (e.g., heads, vehicles, etc.).

## Installation and Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python (version 3.6 or higher).
   - Set up a virtual environment (recommended).
   - Install required packages (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, YOLO weights).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/head-detection-yolo8.git
   cd head-detection-yolo8
