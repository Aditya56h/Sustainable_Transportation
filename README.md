# Car Number Plate Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect car number plates using computer vision techniques. When a red line appears in front of a car, the system captures a small photo of the car's number plate. The extracted number plate value is then stored in a MySQL server.

## Features
- **Car Number Plate Detection**: The system identifies cars and draws a red line in front of them.
- **Photo Capture**: When the red line is triggered, a photo of the car's number plate is taken.
- **MySQL Integration**: The extracted number plate value is stored in a MySQL database.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python (version 3.6 or higher).
   - Set up a MySQL server (ensure you have the necessary credentials).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-number-plate-detection.git
   cd car-number-plate-detection
